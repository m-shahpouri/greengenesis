                            Green genesis Co. was selected by the Iraqi government to carry out the design, supply, and
                            manufacturing of the AL-SHATRA sewerage project. The project has a maximum capacity of
                            64,000m<sup>3</sup>/d and includes the construction of a treatment plant, lifting stations,
                            and sewer
                            systems. Due to the financial constraints caused by the Iraq situation and the COVID-19
                            pandemic, the project was suspended from 2015 to 2020. The project timeline was extended due
                            to budget limitations resulting from the war with ISIS.
